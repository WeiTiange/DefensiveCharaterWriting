This patient is named Peter, and this is the first time he has come to my clinic.

"knock knock"

The door is open,
}

Doctor: How is your day, Peter?

Peter: I don't know.

Doctor: Anything happens?

Peter: I somehow think I was dead, but I don't know why I am still alive.

Doctor: Tell me more detail about yourself.

Peter: I am a student studying in middle school, but just a few months ago, I got bullied.

*["Where are your parents?"]

-"Where are your parents?"

-Peter: My parents are working out of town, and nobody really cares about me.

-Doctor: How about your teacher?

-Peter: My teacher, you are saying that bi*ch?

-Doctor: What happened to her?

-Peter: She only cares about my grade. I told her I got bullied, but she just said I needed to have a good relationship with them.

-Doctor: I see.

-Doctor: Is there more information that you want to tell me?

-Peter: Oh yes, one more thing. I somehow can dream that bi*ch while I am sleeping. She is still teaching me! It makes me crazy!!!!

-Doctor: No worry, I will give you some medicine to help you.

+[Stand up and take a small bottle of pills]

-Doctor: Make sure to take the pill before you sleep, quarters of the tablet.

-Peter: Thank you! Doctor.

-Doctor: I will see you next week.
