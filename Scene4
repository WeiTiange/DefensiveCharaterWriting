This patient named Rick is the first time he has come to my clinic.

"knock knock"

The door is open,
}

Doctor: How is your day, Rick?

Rick: Really tired.

Doctor: Anything that makes you stress?

Rick: I am chasing a criminal.

Doctor: Oh! What kind of criminal?

Rick: She is a teacher, she has been making student suicide during her teaching time, but she says it is not her fault. However, I have found evidence that she made her student die, and I got to catch her!

Doctor: Sounds dangerous. Did you catch her?

Rick: Not yet. I don't know why. Every time while I am chasing her, she could always successfully escape, really wired.

Doctor: You will catch her.

Rick: I know.

Doctor: Any information about the student?

Rick: I do not really remember his name, but I know he has a grandpa who is crying every day in front of the school.

Doctor: I see.
