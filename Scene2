This patient is named Jeff, and this is the first time he has come to my clinic.

"knock knock"

The door is open,
}

Doctor: How is your day, Jeff?

Jeff: Tired.

Doctor: Please tell me about yourself.

Jeff: As you see, I am just an old man.

Doctor: You look haggard; what happens?

Jeff: My Grandson dies, and I watch him die. I...I don't know what to do!

+["He cry in front of you"]

-You get up and get him a cup of hot water.

-Doctor: Drink some water, and talk slowly.

-Jeff: He is my only Grandson. Why did he suicide? It is all my fault.

-Doctor: It is not your fault. Please tell me more detail about your Grandson.

-Jeff: His name is Peter, he is in a middle school in our town, and he is one of the best students in his class.

-Jeff: His parents are all working out of town, so I am the one who is taking care of him.

*["Did he say something to you before he suicide"]

-Jeff: He did not say anything, but I can tell he is hiding something.

-Jeff: Oh yes, I remember that he has frequent bruises on his feet and arms.

-Doctor: I know what has happened to him.
