    Doctor: Please come in.
    You see a man in a student's clothing walking in.
    Doctor: Please take a seat.
}

Doctor: What is your name?
Kevin: Kevin.
Doctor: Alright, Kevin, are you ready for today's treatment?
Kevin: I am ready.
Doctor: How is your day, Kevin?
Kevin: I do not know what to say.
Doctor: You can say whatever you want here.
Kevin: I thought I was dead, but I am still alive.
Doctor: What do you mean?
Kevin: I somehow remember that I jumped off the school's roof.
Doctor: What happened?
Kevin: I am very depressed, nobody wants to help me, and people around me make me scared.
Doctor: Please tell me more about yourself. 
Kevin: I went to a middle school in this town. Also, my grades were pretty good.

{Scene_1: 
    Doctor: I heard that your teacher is very caring for you.
    Kevin: Caring for me? She's just doing it for her salary.
    Doctor: Why do you say that?
    Kevin: I've heard before that as long as there are more people in a class who get into a good high school, the teacher who teaches the class can get a really high salary.
    Doctor: I see.
}

Doctor: How about your family?
Kevin: Family? My parents work outside yearly and haven't been home for a long time, so I usually live with my grandfather.
Doctor: Do you miss them?
Kevin: Not really. I don't even think they know me as well as my dog.
Doctor: Then the next question may be a little difficult for you to accept. You can choose to answer or not to answer.
Doctor: Why did you suicide?
Kevin：.......
Kevin: I was bullied.

Kevin: I went to my teacher, but that bitch told me to have a good relationship with my classmates and not go to snitch all day.
Doctor: Then, did you tell your family?
Kevin: I just talked to a grandfather at home, and he didn't care. He also said that it was my problem, that I was withdrawn and didn't know how to make friends.

    Doctor: How do you think you are now?
    Kevin: Although I seem to be alive, but I am actually dead, right?
    Doctor: Well, you died a few months ago, but now you're in someone else's body.
    Kevin: So that's why, no wonder, every time I wake up, I feel different, but I can't find it myself.
    Doctor: Do you still hate the guy who bullied you?
    Kevin: Hmm. . . I don't hate him anymore.
    Kevin: But I hate myself for being weak. If I had been braver then, I probably wouldn't have sought suicide.
    Doctor: Everything will be fine.

    Doctor: I have a general understanding of your situation. Is there anything you want to add?
    Kevin: Hmm. . . I want to know what happened to my grandfather; I died, and he must be very sad.
    Doctor: When I get a chance, I'll help you to see him.
    Kevin: Thank you, Doctor.
    Kevin: Do I need any medicine?
    Doctor: Not yet. I'll tell you what medicine to take when the whole diagnosis is over.
    Kevin: Alright.
